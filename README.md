## Constellation

Constellation is a network topology visualizer based on graph information gathered using various methods:
1.  SNMP and LLDP for L2 topology discovery
1.  Prometheus for metrics of monitored nodes
1.  DCIM/IIM API for device location and configuration

This project aims to provide a comprehensive view into data center networks, both overlay and underlay. Furthermore, it can quickly identify and predict congestion area, highlight effected devices when a device is down and traverse packet journey throughout the fabric network.
